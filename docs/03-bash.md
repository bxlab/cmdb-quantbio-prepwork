# Bash

## Goal

Gain an understanding of what bash is and what it can do for you

## Learning Objectives

After going through this module, students should be able to:

* Explain the difference between the command line and bash
* List advantages of bash over a graphical user interface (GUI)

## What is bash

In order to understand what bash is, we first need to define what the command line is. The command line is the text interface with your computer that is brought up when you run `terminal` or another similar program. In computers with no graphical interface, the command line is the only way to interact with the computer.

Bash is a command line interpreter. There are several different interpreters, but bash is quite common and the default on the provided CMDB laptops. What bash does is allows you to

1. navigate through the filesystem
2. interact with files by creating, editing, examining, moving, or deleting them
3. run built-in tools
4. perform some basic logical operations, i.e. a simple form of programming

While bash is not truly a programming language, it can act like one by executing commands either directly or from a file much like other programming languages. 

## Bash vs. a graphical user interface (GUI)

While all of us are very familiar with GUIs (e.g. macOSX or windows), many will be less (or not) familiar with getting the same or more functionality out of the command line through bash. Some of the most powerful features of using bash are text mamipulation and performing repetitive tasks. While on a GUI there is not an easy way to perform the same task or set of tasks repeatedly, bash allows you to create a script that can easily handle even complex sets of tasks repeated on each input.

The biggest disadvantage of the command line and bash compared to a GUI is the learning curve. Many people are nervous to use the command line because of its unfamiliarity, but with a few simple commands, you will be using bash with ease/
