# Logistics

## Goal

Below we describe two ways you can complete these exercises:

* Online Python -- Work "on the Cloud" using your laptop, browser, and internet connection
* Your Own Computer -- Work "locally" with your own Python and text editor

By the end of the actual course, you will be able to run Python scripts from whatever machine you are working on, including accessing local files

## Macs

If you are using a Mac to complete the prepwork, you should be in good shape. Python should be already installed on your computer. You will also need a plain text editor such as TextEdit, TextMate, Sublime, etc. (NOT a wordprocessor like Word, Pages, etc.). Finally, you will need to open iTerm or another comparable terminal program. This will bring up a command line terminal. You can verify that Python is installed by running the command `which python` on the command line. If the result is a filepath ending with some version of 'python', you are all set.

If for some reason Python is not installed or you would prefer to work online, jump to the [Online Python](#Online-Python) section.

## Windows

Unfortunately, Python does not come pre-installed on the Windows OS. You have a couple of options. First, you can install it by downloading the installer from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/). Select whatever Python3 version you want (I would go with 3.10). Then follow the instructions when you run the downloaded installer. Finally, verify that Python was successfully installed by opening `Command Prompt` and running the command `python -V`. This should tell you what version of Python is installed on your system. In addition to Python and Command Prompt, you will also need a plain text editor like Notepad, Sublime, etc.

If you would prefer not to install Python, jump to the [Online Python](#Online-Python) section.

## Unix

If you are on a Unix system, Python should be pre-installed. If not, chances are that you are comfortable installing it yourself using `apt-get`, `dnf`, or whatever the appropriate package manager is for your distro. You will also need a terminal and plain text editor.

If for some reason Python is not installed or you would prefer to work online, jump to the [Online Python](#Online-Python) section.

## Online Python

During your first year in the CMDB program, you will be provided with a laptop with everything you will need preloaded on it. However, for the prepwork you can make use of a Python interpreter available online [here](https://www.online-python.com). If you are not familiar with navigating your filesystem from the command line, we highly recommend making use of the online interface. The online interface includes both a text editing interface to write your scripts in and save them using the "disk" icon above the editor. Below the editor is a "Run" button that executes your code, printing any output in the window below the editor. You can also load external files to make them accessible to your script with the "folder" icon above the editor. Finally, there is a text field that you can use to pass arguments to your script.

## Submitting your final script

Once you have completed the last module, you will need to submit the script you have produced (the tail script). To do this, please name it LASTNAME_tail.py and email it to Kate Weaver at kweave23@jhu.edu.
