## Learning Objectives

## Goal -- recreate the Bash tool `head` in Python; adding some new functionality 

## Coding Blueprint

Let's again start with and edit the pseudocode from the last module to meet the needs of this module.

Last module's pseudocode:

First, we need to SET the input file
Next, IF the user-specified a desired number of lines to display
  THEN we need to SET the desired number of displayed lines
END IF
OTHERWISE 
  THEN we need to SET the desired number of displayed lines to a default
END OTHERWISE
Then, FOR every line in the open file
  IF a desired line (by its numericl position)
    PRINT the line
  END IF
END FOR

We do want to edit this past pseudocode, adding a condition that should be true before we print a line. Edit that line of the pseudocode, expanding it with logical expression language to reflect this change in the program behavior.

ANSWER:

First, we need to SET the input file
Next, IF the user-specified a desired number of lines to display
  THEN we need to SET the desired number of displayed lines
END IF
OTHERWISE 
  THEN we need to SET the desired number of displayed lines to a default
END OTHERWISE
Then, FOR every line in the open file
  IF a desired line (by its numericl position) AND NOT a header line
    PRINT the line
  END IF
END FOR

We also, can no longer assume that the numerical position of the line within the file corresponds to the number of lines that have been printed since we're filtering out the header. Therefore, we need to track the number of lines that have been printed. Add two lines to the pseudocode that will help you do this, and further edit the conditional that we check before printing a line.

ANSWER:

First, we need to SET the input file
Next, IF the user-specified a desired number of lines to display
  THEN we need to SET the desired number of displayed lines
END IF
OTHERWISE 
  THEN we need to SET the desired number of displayed lines to a default
END OTHERWISE
SET counter of number of lines that have been displayed to 0
Then, FOR every line in the open file
  IF a desired line (counter hasn't reached desired number of lines) AND NOT a header line
    PRINT the line
    SET counter to ADD one
  END IF
END FOR

## Building the code

**Create a new Python script**

Within your Python script, you should have the twelve lines of code together which makes our complete intended goal code -- code that prints a user specified number of lines from the beginning of a user specified input file, skipping header lines that begin with a pound sign (`#`).

**Use the command line to run the Python script and look at the output**

## Complete Intended Goal Code
```{python, eval = FALSE}
#USAGE: #USAGE: python scriptname.py input_filename [number_lines_to_display]
import sys #import module
filename = sys.argv[1] #SET the input filename
if len(sys.argv) > 2: #IF user-specified number of lines provided
  n_lines = int(sys.argv[2]) #SET the desired number of lines
else: #OTHERWISE
  n_lines = 10 #SET the desired number of lines to a default
counter = 0 #SET counter of number of lines that have been displayed ot 0
for line in open(filename): #FOR every line in the open file
  if counter < n_lines and not line.startswith("#"): #IF the counter hasn't reached the max number of desired lines AND NOT a header line
    print(line.strip('\r\n')) #PRINT the line
    counter = counter + 1 #SET counter to add one
```
